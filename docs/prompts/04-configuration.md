Generate a configuration guide for grove-gemini.

## Requirements
Document how to configure grove-gemini for interacting with Google's Gemini API:

1. **API Configuration**: Setting up API keys and authentication
2. **Model Selection**: Configuring default models and model-specific settings
3. **Context Configuration**: Grove context integration settings
4. **Environment Variables**: Document all relevant environment variables (except caching/observability)
5. **Configuration Files**: Explain configuration file formats and locations

## Structure
Include practical examples of configurations for common use cases:
- Basic API setup
- Model selection and parameters
- Context-aware prompting configuration
- Basic usage settings

## Note
DO NOT include caching or observability configuration here - those are documented in the Experimental section.

## Context
Show how grove-gemini provides a powerful CLI interface to Google's Gemini models with advanced features like caching, context management, and seamless Grove ecosystem integration.
