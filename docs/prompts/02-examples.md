Generate practical examples for grove-gemini that demonstrate increasing complexity:

## Requirements
Create three distinct examples showing how to use grove-gemini for AI-powered development:

1. **Example 1: Basic API Interaction** - Simple requests and responses with Gemini API
2. **Example 2: Context-Aware Development** - Using grove-context integration for enhanced AI assistance
3. **Example 3: Advanced Workflows** - Caching, observability, and complex multi-turn interactions

## Structure
For each example, provide:
- Complete command examples with flags and options
- Sample context files and their structure
- Expected responses and how to interpret them
- Configuration recommendations

## Context Integration
Reference how grove-gemini leverages:
- grove-context for intelligent code understanding
- grove-meta for unified CLI experience
- Caching system for performance optimization
- Observability features for debugging and monitoring

Focus on practical examples that demonstrate grove-gemini's power for real development workflows, from simple queries to sophisticated AI-assisted coding sessions.
