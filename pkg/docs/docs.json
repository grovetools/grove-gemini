          "content": "*   **Context Management**: Builds prompt context by reading a `.grove/rules` file and passing matching files to the API. This process is handled by `grove-context`.\n\n*   **Caching (experimental)**: Caches \"cold context\" files using the Gemini Caching API. This feature is opt-in via an `@enable-cache` directive in the rules file. A terminal interface (`grove-gemini cache tui`) is available for cache management.\n\n*   **API Usage Querying**: Includes a `query` command to inspect API usage from multiple sources: `query local` for local request logs, `query metrics` for Google Cloud Monitoring, `query tokens` for Google Cloud Logging, and `query billing` for BigQuery exports.\n\n*   **Token Utilities**: Provides a `count-tokens` command to estimate the token count and cost for a given text before making an API call."

          "content": "When `grove-gemini request` is executed, it performs the following steps:\n1.  It checks for a `.grove/rules` file in the current project. If found, it uses `grove-context` to generate `hot-context` and `cached-context` files based on the defined patterns.\n2.  If caching is enabled via an `@enable-cache` directive, the tool attempts to find a valid cache for the static `cached-context` file. If a valid cache is not found or if file contents have changed, it creates a new cache using the Gemini Caching API.\n3.  A request is sent to the Gemini API containing the user's prompt, any `hot-context` files, and a reference to the cached content (if used).\n4.  The tool logs request metrics locally and prints the API response to standard output."

This context is then provided to the Gemini API.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall via the Grove meta-CLI:\n\nVerify installation:\n\nRequires the `grove` meta-CLI.
